I'm learning Scala 3 and using the following resources:
- [Scala 3 book](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html#)
- [Programming in Scala, Fifth Edition](https://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_5ed)

All the demo codes in this repo are typed manually and come from the source codes of the above two books. 
Huge thanks to the two books, which are really fantastic learning resources for Scala.
